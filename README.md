This is the first coding assignment (Lab 1)  of the semester in CSC 172 and my partner and I made this in eclipse. In this program there are two methods. The first one  which takes takes two strings as input and decides if one string is a rotation of the other and then returns a statement saying whether the strings are or aren't rotations of each other. Like the rotations method, the second one takes two strings as input and decides if those strings are anagrams of each other or not. To run the program press the green "run" arrow and you will be prompted to enter the first string for the rotation method, after you enter that you will be prompted to enter the second string for the second method. From there, the program will say whether the strings are or aren't rotations of each other. After the rotations result is printed, you will be asked to enter your first phrase for the anagram, after you enter that you will be asked to enter the second phrase for the anagram. From there, the program will say whether the strings are or aren't rotations of each other.
